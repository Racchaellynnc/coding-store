                Best Supplements to Enhance your Brain. 
            </div>
            <div className='blog-intro'>
                Before I started taking supplements, I found it very hard to stay focused for long periods of time. That 
                is an essential skill if you want to be a programmer. I'm going to share my favorite supplements with you and why I take them.'

                    Lets start with Beta Glucan.
                </div>
                <div className="section">
                    Beta Glucan is a form of sugars found inside the walls of algae cells. They have been used as medicine to treat 
                    a number of diseases including cancer, HIV, influenza, IBS, allergies, arthritis, chronic fatigue, respiratory infections and many more.
                     Beta Glucan is the most recent supplement that I have discovered and with CoronaVirus spreading throughout the world, I am very 
                    glad that I did. For years I have been dealing with allergies. As soon as I started taking Beta Glucan, they no longer affect me. 
                    It is inexpensive and completely worth the extra 15 dollars a month! I feel like nothing in the world can stop me now.

            Diatamaceuos Earth
        </div>
        <div className="section">
            Diatomaceous Earth is one of the first supplements that I started taking. It is made out of silica and other essential mineral that help to detoxify and cleasne your digestive system. 
            It works by binding to heavy metal and toxins and moving them out of the body. I have suffered from Gluten Intolerance for over ten years
            and found out about it three years ago. I went threw a phase where the only thing I wanted to do was sleep and watch movies. Nothing 
            could motivate me, not even coffee. Thats when I started my research and found out that 80% of people who have gluten intolerance, 
            don't even know that they have it. When I accidently ingest Gluten, I use Diatamaceous Earth to help relieve the symptoms and get back to normal. If you decide 
            to try it out, make sure you buy food grade because there is another kind that has poison for killing pests.

            Here is an inexpensive brand that also comes with a scoop. I recommend getting one similar to this.

            Schisandra Berry
        </div>
        <div className="section">
            Schisandra berry is an amazing berry that helps increase your adrenal function, memory, focus, and helps you deal with stress.
            Dealing with stress is essential if you have kids. I don't know how the heck I could be a programmer and also take care of my kids without some kind of stress relief. 
            I have noticed that my skin quality has also improved after taking schisandra berry. Overall, I think it is great to supplement with! I like to 
            use the liquid form because it is easily absorbed by the body but the pill forms have similar effects. 
        </div>
        <div className="section">
            The first one is the brand that I am currently using although I would recommend Organic. 
            I only bought the non-organic because I purchased it at the vitamin shop and it was the only option.

            Brain Boost
        </div>
        <div className="section">
            This one is my favorite. Before I got a job as a Web Developer, I took this every day because 
            I was having a hard time remembering how to solve algorithms.  
            It really has helped me remember things more clearly. It is a combination of B12, 
            Bacopa Monnieri, Ginko Biloba, DHEA, and a few other ingredients. 
            
        </div>
        <div className="section">
            I highly recommend it if you have a hard time remembering because it increased my memory by about 50%.

                Caffine L-theanine
            </div>
             <div className='section'>
                This is another one of my favorites. I am sure you have seen the memes about programmers turning coffee into code, 
                but I don't like coffee. I gives me bad breath and stains my teeth. It also gives me a headache and sometimes makes me
                want to sleep instead of giving me energy. Redbulls are even worse because of all the sugar. I am so happy that I found 
                this supplement because it gives me so much motivation! I love it! The L-Theanine combined with caffine makes it so you 
                don't suffer from a bad caffine withdrawal. I never get headaches anymore like I used to get with coffee and redbulls.
